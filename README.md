 #### By the end of this project :
 - We'll  be able to understand the problem to classify if it is a regression or a    classification kind of problem.
- We will be able to know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.
 - Applying different algorithms according to the dataset
 - We will be able to know how to find the accuracy of the model.
- We will be able to build web applications using the Flask framework.

### In order to develop this project we need to install the following software/packages:
#### Step 1:
#### Anaconda Navigator :
naconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Conda is an open-source, cross-platform,  package management system. Anaconda comes with great tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code.

#### Step 2:
To build Machine learning models you must require the following packages
   
**Sklearn:** Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.
   
**NumPy:** NumPy is a Python package that stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object  
   
**Pandas:** pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,built on top of the Python programming language.
   
**Matplotlib:** It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits.
   
**Flask:** Web framework used for building Web applications.

If you are using anaconda navigator, follow below steps to download required packages:

>1.Open anaconda prompt.
   
>2.Type ‚Äúpip install numpy‚Äù and click enter.
   
>3.Type ‚Äúpip install pandas‚Äùand click enter.
   
>4.Type ‚Äúpip install matplotlib‚Äùand click enter.
   
>5.Type‚Äúpip install scikit-learn‚Äùand click enter.
   
>6.Type‚Äúpip install Flask‚Äùand click enter.

## Introduction : <picture> <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f38a/512.gif" alt="üéä" width="30" height="30"></picture>
There are a number of users who purchase products online and make payments through e-banking. There are e-banking websites that ask users to provide sensitive data such as username, password & credit card details, etc., often for malicious reasons. This type of e-banking website is known as a phishing website. Web service is one of the key communications software services for the Internet. Web phishing is one of many security threats to web services on the Internet. 

Common threats of web phishing : <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Exploding%20Head.png" alt="Exploding Head" width="25" height="25" /> 

>1.  Web phishing aims to steal private information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card    details, by way of impersonating a legitimate entity.

>2.  It will lead to information disclosure and property damage.

>3.  Large organizations may get trapped in different kinds of scams.

>4.  This Guided Project mainly focuses on applying a machine-learning algorithm to detect Phishing websites.

This Guided Project mainly focuses on applying a machine-learning algorithm to detect Phishing websites.

In order to detect and predict e-banking phishing websites, we proposed an intelligent, flexible and effective system that is based on using classification algorithms.  We implemented classification algorithms and techniques to extract the phishing datasets criteria to classify their legitimacy. The e-banking phishing website can be detected based on some important characteristics like URL and domain identity, and security and encryption criteria in the final phishing detection rate. Once a user makes a transaction online when he makes payment through an e-banking website our system will use a data mining algorithm to detect whether the e-banking website is a phishing website or not.
